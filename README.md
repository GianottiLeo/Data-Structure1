# Data-Structure
One of my projects developed during my course in USP SME0827

The project description was the following 

The objective of this work is to implement an Interactive Fiction game, in Python 3, based on text. The game execution should occur on the command line (terminal).
The game to be implemented is an enigma where the main character starts trapped in a particular environment. The goal is to reach a "final" environment. The character can move, observe the environment, and each object present in it. Some objects are interactive; they can be collected into the character's inventory and used through an action. The player needs to find ways to use the objects to open doors and compartments, thus progressing toward their objective. The mechanics are very similar to the game "Zork," available at https://cutt.ly/DnfHh7y
#
The story and narrative are free; each group can create the story they want (provided there are no offenses). The game can be in Portuguese or English. Some terms can be abbreviated (for example, "move south" instead of "move to south"), as long as it is clear to the user.

The game must satisfy several conditions:
- There must be four or more environments.
- There must be an inventory for object collection by the player.
- Each environment must contain three or more interactive objects (that can be placed in the inventory) and three or more non-interactive objects.
- Each interactive object must have at least one corresponding action.
- All environments and objects must have a description that can be accessed through an action (e.g., "look at" action).
- At least eight interactive objects must be used to win the game.
- At the beginning, the player must be introduced to the narrative (for example: "You are Andy's favorite toy and you are lost in the attic...").
- Upon typing help or h in the terminal, a brief description of available actions and/or instructions for the player should be presented.
