# Python Text Game
One of my projects developed during my course in USP SME0827

The project description was the following 

The objective of this work is to implement an Interactive Fiction game, in Python 3, based on text. The game execution should occur on the command line (terminal).
The game to be implemented is an enigma where the main character starts trapped in a particular environment. The goal is to reach a "final" environment. The character can move, observe the environment, and each object present in it. Some objects are interactive; they can be collected into the character's inventory and used through an action. The player needs to find ways to use the objects to open doors and compartments, thus progressing toward their objective. The mechanics are very similar to the game "Zork," available at https://cutt.ly/DnfHh7y and the image attached

The story and narrative are free; each group can create the story they want (provided there are no offenses). The game can be in Portuguese or English. Some terms can be abbreviated (for example, "move south" instead of "move to south"), as long as it is clear to the user.

The game must satisfy several conditions:
- There must be four or more environments.
- There must be an inventory for object collection by the player.
- Each environment must contain three or more interactive objects (that can be placed in the inventory) and three or more non-interactive objects.
- Each interactive object must have at least one corresponding action.
- All environments and objects must have a description that can be accessed through an action (e.g., "look at" action).
- At least eight interactive objects must be used to win the game.
- At the beginning, the player must be introduced to the narrative (for example: "You are Andy's favorite toy and you are lost in the attic...").
- Upon typing help or h in the terminal, a brief description of available actions and/or instructions for the player should be presented.

### My Insights

I always loved games so working on this project was a delight. It was my first time creating a game and even though the final product was not super complex, I liked it a lot. Here's what I took away from this project:

- Data Structure understanding solidification: Initially, the concept of nodes and trees seemed abstract to me, but as I started implementing them in my game, I began to grasp their practical applications and that made it easy for me to solidify the conceps in my mind. Building the game world using nodes helped me visualize the structure of the game, understand how different paths could intersect and diverge and clarify the code aspect of it as well.

- Algorithmic thinking: Designing the logic behind player choices and game progression challenged me and my group to think algorithmically. We had to consider how to traverse the tree structure efficiently, handle player input dynamically and manage game states effectively. This process upgrated my problem-solving skills and taught me to approach complex problems with a systematic mindset.

- Debugging and Testing: Like any coding project, We had our problems along the way. However, debugging and testing we got valuable lessons. I feel that after this project I can identify root causes of issues, debug and write way faster

- Project Management: Managing the development of my game taught me important lessons in project management. Working togheter with my group all evolved our ways to express ideas, show data and overall, work as a group

So, creating this text-based Python game was an great experience that not only deepened my understanding of fundamental programming concepts (specialy in Python), but also allowed me to unleash my creativity and problem-solving skills. It's a project that I'm proud of and one that has equipped me with valuable skills that I can apply to future endeavors in the field of computer science and beyond.
